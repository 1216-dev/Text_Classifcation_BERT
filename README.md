# Text_Classifcation_BERT
The project leverages the pre-trained BERT model to classify emails based on their content. This can be useful for automatically organizing emails into categories such as "spam," "promotions," "social," or any other user-defined categories. 

# BERT Email Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for a **BERT-based Email Classification** project. The goal of this project is to classify emails into predefined categories using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a powerful natural language processing (NLP) model.

## Project Overview

The project leverages the pre-trained BERT model to classify emails based on their content. This can be useful for automatically organizing emails into categories such as "spam," "promotions," "social," or any other user-defined categories. The project involves fine-tuning the BERT model on a labeled dataset of emails and using it to predict the category for unseen emails.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization and cleaning of email text for model input.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning of a pre-trained BERT model on the labeled email dataset.
- **Email Classification**: Predicting the category of an email based on its content.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the model.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run the project:

- Python 3.7+
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

To install the dependencies, run:
